# Digital Character Sheet
A character sheet for friends to use on DCC/MCC games.

## Why does this exist?
* Keep track of character(s) in a digital format.
* Share character(s) with party and GM
* Reduce mental load of calculating stats
* Improve visual design/layout of character data

Sounds good, right? But what does it mean? Let's break it down.

> Keep track of character(s) in a digital format.

Defining a character as structured data makes storing, sharing, and manipulating that character simpler for the remote gaming party.

> Share character(s) with party and GM

Gaming remotely presents a challenge when a character exists on paper. We want to give GMs and PCs a convenient tool to share character data.

> Reduce mental load of calculating stats

Crunching numbers mid-game can take away from immersion and confuse new PCs. This application will reduce data-input required by PCs and automate stat/modifier/save/etc. calculations.

> Improve visual design/layout of character data

Parsing character sheets is dizzying! We hope to create a visually appealing and efficient interface.
